# The problem

As a guardian you might want to track your child's location to make sure they
don't stray too far from where they should be.

## Requirements

Among others it's important that the child's location be kept in absolute secret
as it is a very sensitive piece of information.

## Trust Assumptions

There are 3 actors in the system:

- Server
- Guardians
- Children
